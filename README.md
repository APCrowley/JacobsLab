# JacobsLab

Shared repository for the Jacobs Lab of Cognitive Biology. All datasets are saved in full on Google Drive, and the files saved here are primarily for testing and demonstration. 

Additionally, all file paths are intended to work on Andrew's SSD and may need to be altered to be run on other machines.
